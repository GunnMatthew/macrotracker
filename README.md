Creating a macro tracker for personal use as I currently have a very tedious method of maintaining my diet.  This is a work in progress.

Things still in progress:

- [X] Daily intake tracking
- [X] Remove foods (mistakes happen)
- [X] User consumption input
- [X] automatic unit conversion for easy macro tracking
- [ ] UI, because doing this in a console is inefficient
- [ ] Database to store "common" meals.  Custom meals that the user frequently eats
- [ ] Database for restaurant foods
