Creating a macro tracker for personal use as I currently have a very tedious method of maintaining my diet.  This is a work in progress.

Things still in progress:

- [ ] Daily intake tracking
- [X] Remove foods (mistakes happen)
- [ ] User consumption input/automatic unit conversion for easy macro tracking
- [ ] UI (Not planned until logic is completed)
- [ ] More that would make something like this useful for me
